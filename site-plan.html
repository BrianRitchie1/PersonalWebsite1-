        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        My website will contain lots of information about Esports teams, what they're about, where out of and What results they have.This will be very advantageous to anybody looking to find results on major Esports tournaments because it is often very very hard to find anything on the internet that has solid, easy to read results. This will be due to my websites being very easy to use by nature, as well as looking good. A lot of Esports websites are very counterintuitive to how they are laid out, making results hard to find, or just very unclear. This can be frustrating to anybody who has tried to support an Esports team through their results because you cannot find them at all. This is especially true in earnings reports, where there are many extremely varied sources on the amount of winnings a tournament gives out to a particular team. This hinders those who are looking to get into Esports because they don't know how much a good team makes, so how are they going to know how much they can make out of this industry.

      <h3>Questions</h3>
      <p>
        I believe that the very nature of this website will be to answer any questions people have about esports winnings. This includes Revenue, placement, and the title of what the event was. this way they will immediately know what they're looking at and the placements that were given. Provided I have the skill, this website could also show just how good a team has been doing and the trends through simple graphs. This website would also be able to direct them to any of the Esports teams own websites, so that they can find and be able to support them through whatever means they deem fit.

      <h3>Why Us?</h3>
      <p>
        As far as I know, most Esports results are found in Backwater ugly freaking terrible websites. I would just like to simplify the process. People will come to my website because it is good and good websites are hard to find. I also think that it would be a great way to officially have a hub for those who want to write about Esports in the future if this ever were to get off the ground. A lot of Esports is very corporate and obnoxious in this sense, and cutting through it as a independent writer/editor slash I don't know website developer would speak to a lot of people in ways that previous websites or current websites just do not.
