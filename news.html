        <p> Endangered Esports: How Much Further to Extinction?

            Esports is an industry revolving around the competition in certain multiplayer gaming titles. Many popular tournaments with large prize pools have been completed in this year alone, yet the industry finds itself struggling. With many popular online creators participating, there seems to be no shortage of eyes on this industry, confounding many as to why they are not growing rapidly.  I have often wondered how this industry has found itself in this situation, and what options do they have to get back on their feet. 
            There are some that don’t understand why there is such a great following around esports. Why would anyone want to see other people play video games? The same reason people go to huge coliseums with thousands of other like minded people: To escape. In a research paper written by Juho Hamari, it is theorized that esports has a very strong connection with escapism. Those who go to esports events are there because they want to see the best in their fields compete against other incredible players. Regardless of skill level in that title, people can be somewhere where great things are happening, and that can’t happen inside their own homes.
            Charles White, the owner of the esports group Moist and shareholder of MoistMougles, makes note of the struggles that his groups go through. Oftentimes, Mr. White says that, “Esports is not a profitable field, period”. He alludes to this due to the extreme fee that are placed upon teams that enter these tournaments, which are often times too high in comparison to the money that would be made if teams were to participate. This is most notable in the Overwatch League, where entry fees can be in the millions, while the league provides no opportunity to make that money back, providing only a slowly declining tournament scene.
            This lack of provisions runs deeper, as the major tournaments provide very little other than a place for the competitor to compete. As mentioned earlier, people are here to be a part of something great, so why not incorporate this into the events themselves. Many other large sports meetings have crowd activities, and I think that they need to add more events to entice people to buy tickets to these events. As an example, while teams are in their off time, they could have a booth where people can challenge these top players in a best to five. This would give many people something to do while their team is waiting to play, and would give a much better reason to actually show up to the competitions.
            Keeping extra activities in mind, everybody loves getting money. Thinking back to the last basketball game anyone can remember the raffle, or the half time mini-game where a stranger can make a few baskets for a thousand dollars. People love to get money, and giving them a chance to do so is important. Like any good show, retention is important for these events, and quality is always better than quantity, and what’s better than free money? While these things are great for those who are or are considering attending an esports event, we need to consider the current ecosystem of the esports leagues: sponsorships.
            Sponsorships have always been the lifeblood of sports, with major brands putting their name on substantial events in exchange for substantial money. Prime examples can be found in the Pepsi bowl, a NASCAR’s driver outfit, or how Nike has its logo on most basketball players outfits. Unfortunately, there has yet to be sponsored competitions in esports that have broken into the mainstream media. This lack of coordination with large brands only goes to hurt the wallets of the teams involved. Potential millions are being wasted on missed opportunities, both in sponsorships and in advertising. As an example, I will use an example from Australia, a group called Exo. Exo Clan, (the full title of the group),  is backed by Mad Catz, a company that sells gaming equipment. Unfortunately, in the many hours of footage played by Exo, Mad Catz isn’t mentioned at all. Why would a major company want to be advertised in esports if their name isn’t going to be mentioned at all?  
            There also seems to be a serious lack of infrastructure for esports as well. Many other sports have entire stadiums dedicated to them, whereas esports have little to no real permanent presence. This lack of permanence also becomes a lack of advertising, as no one will know that a competition happened once the chairs are folded back up. Since esports is usually locally connected through wires, there is a reason to have more dedicated space for people to practice and use that space as they would a basketball court. Promoting esports, creating better public access to high end computer components, as well as allowing a space for anyone to get started all come with the permanency of a dedicated connected computer space.
            Another huge advertising space that esports is missing out on is in official government recognition and support. If players around the world can convince their governments that esports is serious and worth investing in, groups could go at it against each other on the big stage: the Olympics. If olympic esports teams were to compete, it would not only provide exposure to the industry but also validate esports as a legitimate sport. Including esports in the Olympics would open up doors to additional funding, sponsorships, and opportunities for players to showcase their skills on a global platform. Moreover, the Olympic Games' reputation for promoting unity, sportsmanship, and friendly competition could help defeat negative stereotypes associated with video gaming and change the perception of esports as respectable. The collaboration between esports and the Olympics could mark a significant milestone in the industry's growth and further solidify its position in the mainstream media.
            As it stands, the current position of esports as a mainstream entertainment source is sorely lacking. Some of the faults found in this industry are no doubt due to its extremely young age, but other faults need to be addressed before it crashes and burns. No matter which way the industry moves, the potential will still remain, and the choice will ultimately be up to the actions of the teams and developers that created the space. They can either choose greed, and place money above viewers and everything else, and extinguish the spark that resides in the fans hearts, or choose to work with the teams and community that loves it dearly, and create an unstoppable force.
